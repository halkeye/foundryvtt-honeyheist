## Description
Honey Heist is a one-page RPG by Grant Howitt available to download for free [here](https://gshowitt.itch.io/honey-heist). The system includes a character sheet for players and roll tables for the GM.

### For Players
Open the actor the GM created for you. On the character sheet, you'll find options for each attribute which you can choose yourself or roll for. Click the die icon next to each to let the dice decide for you.

When the GM asks for a roll during the game, click the single or double dice icon next to the relevant stat (bear or criminal). If you're using one of your bear skills or doing something related to your role, use the double dice. It will roll both and choose the lower die. You want to roll under or equal to your stat.

If you want to manually transfer a point into bear or criminal, click the relavant icon next to the word "Bear" or "Criminal". Look at the chat message to see what you need to role-play.

### For GMs
There are four roll tables available for randomly creating the details of HoneyCon. There is one each for determining the organizer, setting, location, and prize.

## That's it!
This is a very simple system for a very simple (but awesome) game. Enjoy!
